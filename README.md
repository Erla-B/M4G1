I admit I struggled a bit with this one and it's definitely my ugliest project yet! 

But in the end I managed to make a very simple meme generator. I would have liked to use the 'boxes' option for the inputs since that would have offered as many text boxes as the memes offer. As is, it is only possible to input two seperate text boxes so some of the memes are definitely unusable. I would have tried to fix this if I had the time!

I used little styling this time, just changed the background/text color and put in some margins and paddings as well as fix the size of the images.

Unfortunately there's no way to go back on this page, if you reload you go to the homepage with all the memes.

I'm really not confident in React but at least I managed to make something that works somewhat! I tried to put comments in regularly to explain what I'm doing but they could probably be more detailed, I'm not very good at explaining code since my understanding of it is rather limited.
